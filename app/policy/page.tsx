              <br />
              5. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?
              <br /> In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary
              to fulfil the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless
              otherwise required by law. We will only keep your personal
              information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set
              out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is
              required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other
              legal requirements). When we have no ongoing legitimate business
              need to process your personal information, we will either delete
              or anonymise such information, or, if this is not possible (for
              example, because your personal information has been stored in
              backup archives), then we will securely store your personal
              information and isolate it from any further processing until
              deletion is possible.
              <br />
              <br /> 6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?
              <br /> In Short: We aim to protect your personal information
              through a system of organisational and technical security
              measures. We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical
              and organisational security measures designed to protect the
              security of any personal information we process. However, despite
              our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no
              electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage
              technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot
              promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other
              unauthorised third parties will not be able to defeat our security
              and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information.
              Although we will do our best to protect your personal information,
              transmission of personal information to and from our Services is
              at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a
              secure environment. <br />
              <br />
              7. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?
              <br /> In Short: We do not knowingly collect data from or market
              to children under 18 years of age. We do not knowingly solicit
              data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using
              the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you
              are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such
              minor dependent&apos;s use of the Services. If we learn that
              personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been
              collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable
              measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you
              become aware of any data we may have collected from children under
              age 18, please contact us at gowild.dogwalking@gmail.com.

              Area (EEA) and United Kingdom (UK), you have rights that allow you
              greater access to and control over your personal information. You
              may review, change, or terminate your account at any time. In some
              regions (like the EEA and UK), you have certain rights under
              applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i)
              to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information,
              (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the
              processing of your personal information; and (iv) if applicable,
              to data portability. In certain circumstances, you may also have
              the right to object to the processing of your personal
              information. You can make such a request by contacting us by using
              the contact details provided in the section &apos;HOW CAN YOU
              CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?
              <br /> &apos; below. We will consider and act upon any request in
              accordance with applicable data protection laws. If you are
              located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully
              processing your personal information, you also have the right to
              complain to your Member State data protection authority or UK data
              protection authority. If you are located in Switzerland, you may
              contact the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner.
              Withdrawing your consent: If we are relying on your consent to
              process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw
              your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any
              time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the
              section &apos;HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?
              <br /> &apos; below. However, please note that this will not
              affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor,
              will it affect the processing of your personal information
              conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than
              consent. Opting out of marketing and promotional communications:
              You can unsubscribe from our marketing and promotional
              communications at any time by replying &apos;STOP&apos; or

              CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?
              <br /> &apos; below. You will then be removed from the marketing
              lists. However, we may still communicate with you — for example,
              to send you service- related messages that are necessary for the
              administration and use of your account, to respond to service
              requests, or for other non-marketing purposes. If you have
              questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us
              at Gowild.dogwalking@gmail.com.

                mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a
                DoNot-Track (&apos;DNT&apos;) feature or setting you can
                activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data
                about your online browsing activities monitored and collected.
                At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognising and
                implementing DNT signals has been finalised. As such, we do not
                currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism
                that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked
                online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we
                must follow in the future, we will inform you about that
                practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.
